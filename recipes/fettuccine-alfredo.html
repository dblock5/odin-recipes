        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and
        cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

        In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt,
        pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted;
        this will thicken the sauce.
