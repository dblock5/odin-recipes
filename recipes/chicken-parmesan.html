    <h1>Chicken Parmesan</h1>
    <img src="../images/parm.jpg" alt="Chicken Parmesan" />
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Oven baked version of chicken parmesan, that is crispier but contains less
      sauce than other recipes. Less sauce make this recipe less soggy,
      crispier, and more delicious. I would recommend not putting sauce on the
      bottom of the chicken only on top, so the chicken stays crispy. I also use
      actual parmesan cheese in this recipe, usually other recipes only use
      mozzarella cheese.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
      <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic on a solid,
        level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat
        mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt
        and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts,
        evenly coating both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the
        bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each
        breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it
        begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2
        minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons
        tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella
        cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan
        over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and
        chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
    </ol>
